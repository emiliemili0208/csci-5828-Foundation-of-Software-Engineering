## Homework 1

1.	Define the term essential difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an essential difficulty.

  Essential difficulties are inherent problems that software has naturally and there is no techniques to solve software engineering problems. Besides, it is hard to have significant development in software engineering like the progress in computer hardware. In general, Brooks presented four inherent properties of essence problems in software systems to explain the reasons cause software hard to have incredible improvement: complexity, conformity, changeability and invisibility.  
	As mentioned in the article, software is not easily to described and the states are too complex. In my experience, even though I try to write a small program, the relationships between each function and objects would cause problem as well. After numbers of modification of code, there are chances that I am confused by the code I made due to invisibility. As a result, I would set up the work process, UML and main goal before I start my work try to reduce the possibility of this situation.  Moreover, how to illustrate the code to others is also a difficult issue. besides, it is also a problem when I try to debug, because there is no visualized aids to know where the bug is.
	Hence, I couldn’t agree more with this article in the essence difficulties such as complexity and invisibility.  


1.	Define the term accidental difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an accidental difficulty.


1.	List and briefly describe the four essential difficulties of developing software systems that Brooks identifies. Provide additional examples of each type of the four essential difficulties.


1.	Define what Brooks means by a silver bullet and reconstruct his argument as to why he believes there is no silver bullet for software engineering.


1.	In lecture, software engineering's relationship to computer science was described by analogy by discussing the differences between a chemist (chemistry) and a chemical engineer (chemical engineering). Define software engineering and its relationship to computer science; make use of the chemist vs. chemical engineer analogy when answering this question.


1.	In lecture, we discussed the importance of the following concepts to software engineers: abstractions, conversations, specification, translation, and iteration. Define each of these concepts as they are related to software engineering and discuss their importance.
